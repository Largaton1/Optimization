An illustration with the admissible cells problem
Given a grid rectangular grid Tm×n of boxes called cells. Some of these cells are admis
le, the others are non-admissible. Also are given m + n non-negative integers l0 . . . lm−1,
. . cn−1. The goal is to fill in the admissible cells with positive integers such as:
— The sum of the numbers allocated on the admissible cells on row i should be less or
equal than li;
— The sum of the numbers allocated on the admissible cells on column j should be less
or equal than cj;
— The total sum of all these numbers should be maximum.
